;How to add images 
;From main menu choose 'Language' and then choose Teachpack
;then from Preinstalled 2htdp\image.rkt
;After adding '2htdp\image.rkt' you will see a yellow bar at the bottom
;After running the program you will see that yellow bar will disapear
;Teachpacks makes new functions available to us
;For example:

;(circle 50 "solid" "green")
;(triangle 60 "solid" "red")

(circle 20 "solid" "darkmagenta")
(triangle 30 "outline" "red")


;We can use 'overlay' operator to overlay those shapes

(overlay(isosceles-triangle 60 45 "solid" "red")
(circle 50 "solid" "orange")(square 100 "solid" "blue"))
(rectangle 60 80 "solid" (make-color 1 2 1 50))
