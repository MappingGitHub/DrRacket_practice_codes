;Functions for Compound Data with using Template
;First Step: Defining Compound Data
;Compound Data is a value that contains other values
;The main concept in compound data is that there is a AND
;For example for a point we need X and Y
;We need a name for the data definition
;We also need the type of things that go to the data definition and the names of fileds

(define-struct cars (model year))
(make-cars "Toyota" 2019)
(make-cars "BMW" 2017)
(make-cars "Ford" 1964)

;Second step: Defining function
;A function to show Smog Test based on the manufacturing year with 2005
;This is a Template sample-->  (cars-model vehicle)
;This is a Template sample-->    (cars-year vehicle)

(define( Passing_smog_test vehicle approved_year)
  (>(cars-year vehicle)approved_year))
;We compare the manufacturing year of each car with year 2005

(check-expect (Passing_smog_test (make-cars "Toyota" 2019)
                                 2005)
              true)
(check-expect (Passing_smog_test (make-cars "BMW" 2017)
                                 2005)
              true)
(check-expect (Passing_smog_test (make-cars "Ford" 1964)
                                 2005)
              false)
